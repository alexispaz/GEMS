# Compilation 

GEMS uses autotools to configure the compilation. If you have download a
tarball of GEMS you can compile by running:

    ./configure
    make

Instead, if you want to clone from GitHub then:

    git clone git@github.com:alexispaz/GEMS.git
    cd GEMS
    autoreconf -fi
    ./configure
    make

Further compiling options are handle
in a standar way. For instance:

    export PATH=/share/apps/gcc/6.2.0/bin/:$PATH
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/share/apps/gcc/6.2.0/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    export FC=gfortran
    exportÂ FCFLAGS=-fno-use-linker-plugin
	./configure --disable-openmp FCFLAGS='-Ofast'

See `./configure --help` for more information

To create a tar ball to run in other computers without autotools use:
  
    make dist

then you only need to configure and make (i.e. `./configure; make`).

## Git subtrees

GEMS uses the following `git subtrees`: 

- Fortran Preprocesor Templates for Dynamic Data Structures (FPT-DDS) 
  url: (https://github.com/alexispaz/FortranTemplates)

- Fortran 90 function parser v1.1
  url: (https://github.com/alexispaz/fparser)

The subtrees were created by:

	git remote add fpt git@github.com:alexispaz/FortranTemplates.git
    git subtree add --prefix lib/fpt fpt master --squash

	git remote add fparser git@github.com:alexispaz/fparser.git
    git subtree add --prefix lib/fparser fparser master --squash

After clone GEMS, to keep the remote relation with the sub projects you can
run:

	git remote add fpt git@github.com:alexispaz/FortranTemplates.git
	git remote add fparser git@github.com:alexispaz/fparser.git
	git fetch fpt
	git fetch fparser

This allows to pull sub projects updates like:

	git pull -s subtree fpt master
